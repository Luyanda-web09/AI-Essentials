# AI-Essentials

An overview of artificial intelligence (AI) and its various approaches, particularly in the context of manufacturing.

Understanding AI and Its Applications

AI can enhance manufacturing operations by addressing specific challenges, such as predicting production yields and detecting defects in products.
Different AI approaches, including machine learning and deep learning, are suited for various problems based on data and complexity.
Machine Learning Techniques

Clustering, a machine learning technique, categorizes data (e.g., shoppers) using algorithms like k-means to optimize advertising strategies.
Deep learning, particularly in image recognition, involves training neural networks with labeled data to classify images accurately.
Reinforcement Learning and Key Concepts

Reinforcement learning (RL) uses trial and error to improve decision-making, exemplified by its application in video games.
Key terms in deep learning include libraries (collections of instructions), frameworks (programming environments), topologies (neural network configurations), and containers (pre-configured AI environments).

The significance of artificial intelligence (AI) in today's business landscape and the increasing volume of data generated by connected devices.

The Importance of AI

AI is essential for businesses to remain competitive and not fall behind.
Industry leaders emphasize the urgency of adopting AI technologies.
Data Generation Trends

In 2019, various smart devices generated massive amounts of data, with smart hospitals producing 3,000 gigabytes and smart factories generating 1 million gigabytes.
The number of connected devices is expected to triple by 2022, leading to an overwhelming amount of data.
Analytics and AI Integration

Data analytics has evolved through five stages: hindsight, insight, foresight, forecast, and act adapt.
AI enhances all phases of the analytics pipeline, particularly in advanced analytics, allowing for better insights and decision-making.
AI's Impact Across Industries

AI is already influencing daily life in both visible and invisible ways.
Companies like Intel are integrating AI into their operations to tackle significant challenges across various sectors.

The typical journey of implementing AI in an organization, emphasizing the steps involved and considerations to ensure success.

Step 1: Discover Phase

Identify potential AI opportunities through brainstorming and external research, including Intel's AI Builders program.
Assess and rank the business value of each AI solution to prioritize the best approach, considering cost and complexity.
Step 2: Data Layer Management

Understand the sources and formats of data, addressing access restrictions and requirements.
Modernize data infrastructure by uniting data silos into a centralized data lake and pre-process data for analysis.
Step 3: Model Development

Set up technology for model development, noting that CPUs can often suffice for deep learning tasks.
Create and train models using various neural network architectures, tuning hyper-parameters for optimal accuracy.
Final Step: Solution Delivery

Collaborate with partners to architect the AI deployment, utilizing drones for defect detection in industrial settings.
Implement the solution in production, ensuring it is scalable and set up for continuous improvement through retraining with new data.

Preparing for customer engagements related to AI, emphasizing the importance of understanding both industry dynamics and specific company contexts.

Understanding Industry Dynamics

Research macro-level forces driving AI adoption in various sectors.
Stay updated on recent AI implementations and trends to engage effectively.
Company-Specific Research

Analyze the company's financial reports and strategic initiatives related to AI.
Investigate historical events and common jargon to better understand the industry.
Engaging with Customers

Identify customer expectations from AI, such as cost savings and improved efficiency.
Recognize potential barriers like data availability, talent, and regulatory concerns when discussing AI strategies.

Tailoring AI conversations to different audiences by using a racing analogy to illustrate their unique motivations and challenges.

Team Owner Perspective

Team owners are interested in forming a racing team to achieve larger goals and need to understand car manufacturers, technology, and expertise.
They hire a crew chief to ensure competitive performance, focusing on metrics like safety and fuel efficiency.
C-Suite and Business Line Managers

C-suite executives view AI as a broad concept that must be operationalized to meet business needs, often perceiving it as marketing hype.
It's essential to understand their challenges and discuss solutions at a high level, determining if AI is necessary for their specific issues.
IT Solution Architects and AI Developers

IT solution architects design data center solutions and prioritize total cost of ownership, security, and manageability over deep learning details.
AI developers, including library developers, data scientists, and application developers, focus on data management and time to solution, often requiring tools that optimize performance and accelerate development.
