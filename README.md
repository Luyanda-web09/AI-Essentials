# AI-Essentials

An overview of artificial intelligence (AI) and its various approaches, particularly in the context of manufacturing.

Understanding AI and Its Applications

AI can enhance manufacturing operations by addressing specific challenges, such as predicting production yields and detecting defects in products.
Different AI approaches, including machine learning and deep learning, are suited for various problems based on data and complexity.
Machine Learning Techniques

Clustering, a machine learning technique, categorizes data (e.g., shoppers) using algorithms like k-means to optimize advertising strategies.
Deep learning, particularly in image recognition, involves training neural networks with labeled data to classify images accurately.
Reinforcement Learning and Key Concepts

Reinforcement learning (RL) uses trial and error to improve decision-making, exemplified by its application in video games.
Key terms in deep learning include libraries (collections of instructions), frameworks (programming environments), topologies (neural network configurations), and containers (pre-configured AI environments).
